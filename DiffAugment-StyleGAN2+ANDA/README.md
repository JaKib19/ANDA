# Evaluation Codes and Pre-trained models of ANDA with StyleGAN2 + DiffAugment and StyleGAN2 + ADA

We provided the pre-trained models of ANDA with StyleGAN2 + DiffAugment and StyleGAN2 + ADA on low-shot datasets for better obtaining the results we reported in the paper.

# Requirement

Please follow the DiffAug-GAN [[link]](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans) and ADA [[link]](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch) to build the envirment required.
