# Evaluation Codes and Pre-trained models of WACV2024 paper ''Improving the Leaking of Augmentations in Data-Efficient GANs via Adaptive Negative Data Augmentation''

We have provided the pre-trained models of ANDA with different DE-GANs on low-shot datasets for better obtaining the results we reported in the paper. The code of this module is built by ourselves based on the test codes of the DiffAug-GAN [[link]](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans) and InsGen [[link]](https://github.com/genforce/insgen) and Diffusion-GAN [[link]](https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Diffusion-GAN). 

# Datasets

The five low-shot datasets can be found in the [[link]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWqaVlms55604jrP5t9ShacL6mZKWL8f/view?usp=sharing)
